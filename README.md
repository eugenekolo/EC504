Java Frontend and Backend GUI

Originally created as a class project by Eugene Kolo & Braxton Brewton.
Now, a nice example of a frontend and backend GUI in Java. 

# Dependencies
You must install gradle, or suffer through installing dependencies yourself. 
This is done via `brew install gradle` on OSX. `sudo apt-get install gradle` on Ubuntu, or visit their website
and download a copy.

# Install and run
     
    ./build.sh && ./algore.sh
